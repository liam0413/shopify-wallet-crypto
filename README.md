## Requirements

- [Create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
- [Create a Development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) for app installation and testing.
- In the Partner dashboard, [create a new app](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/tools/partner-dashboard/your-apps#create-a-new-app) and obtain API credentials.
- [Sign up for NGROK](https://ngrok.com/signup) to host your app in development.

## Development Steps

1. Clone the project and run `npm install`.
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example`.
3. Add `SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<your API key>` from your Shopify App settings.
4. Add `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=<your API secret>`.
5. Add `SHOP=<your shop>.myshopify.com`.
6. Leave `SCOPES` as in the example for now.
7. Start NGROK and replace `HOST` with your `NGROK URL`.

### Shopify App Settings

- Set `App URL` to `NGROK URL`.
- Set `Allowed redirection URL(s)` to `<NGROK URL>/auth/callback` (e.g., https://1231231.ngrok.io/auth/callback).

> _Update `NGROK URL` every time it changes._

8. Run `npm run dev`.
9. Click `Select store` under `Test your app` in Shopify App settings.
